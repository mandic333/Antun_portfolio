    "A CUDA kernel in Numba is a Python function that does *not* return a value. This is in accordance with CUDA, where kernel functions are declared `void`. The arguments of the function can be either Numpy arrays or scalars of a Numba recognized type.\n",
    "\n",
    "CUDA kernels specify the work to be done by a single GPU thread. Due to the massive hardware parallelism available on the GPU, a single GPU thread gets only a tiny portion of work, in this case, the sumation of a single element in the vectors. Since each element is independent from each other, we can safely create as many threads as the elements of the target vectors and spawn them (we will see how later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads on the GPU as organized in groups, called CUDA blocks. There are constraints on the maximum number of threads a block can contain. This means that it will need multiple blocks to calculate the sum of large vectors. The blocks that comprise a kernel form the *grid*. Threads inside a block are numbered sequentially and the blocks inside the grid are numbered, too. \n",

    "```python\n",
    "i = cuda.blockIdx.x*cuda.blockDim.x + threadIdx.x\n",
    "```\n",

    "i = cuda.grid(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument passed to the `grid()` function is the number of dimensions of the grid.\n",

    "The next three statements in the code simply check that we don't overrun the arrays in case that their dimension is not a multiple of the block size. In this case, some threads of the last block will remain idle:\n",

    "    N = x.shape[0]\n",

    "        return\n",
    "```\n",

    "> The threads inside a block are run in batches of 32 at once, called *warps*. All the threads of the warp execute the same instruction. If the program control flow diverges for some of the threads of the warp, e.g., due to an `if` condition, the branches will be executed sequentially by disabling the non participating threads. This condition is called *warp divergence* and may incur a performance penalty.\n",
