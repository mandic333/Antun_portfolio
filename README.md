# Antun_portfolio
I am building my first portfolio with intention to use it in my job application.

## About me

My name is Antun Lucijan MandiÄ‡ and I am a junior machine learning engineer and junior full stack developer.
For last three years, I've been learning as much as I can about this vast and very advanced field of science.
I have builded very strong mathematics foundations with main focus in statistics and linear algebra.
Then I learned Python.
I also used C/C++ and learned the basics, while for object oriented programming I used Java.
But Python is my main languange, the one I want to grow in and master as much as I can.
For backend development, I use Django, and Django Rest Framework for API development. Frontend design is not in my main focus, but I am familiar with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5 and basics of JavaScript.
For DBMS I use MySql.

## About this repository

In this repository, I tried to present some basic notebooks that are necessary for every junior machine learning engineer.
I showed some basic matplotlib plots, introduction to numeric python with numpy, some basic machine learning algorithms wih scikit-learn, and introductionary level of high performance computing with numba.
Pytorch is a framework that I liked very much, and I would like to spend my next few years mastering it.
In the pytroch file I presented introduction to deep learning, CNN-s, RNN-s, then worked with various architectures, like ResNet, VGG, InceptionNet, LeNet, GRU, LSTM and so on...
I know that my protfolio is very far from good, but I seek true knowledge by looking for a job in the field, and waiting for a senior developer who will teach me, lead me, and I hope have a little bit patience with me.


### I am so very excited to be a part of the upcoming 4th industrial revolution.
