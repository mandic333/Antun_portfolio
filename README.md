# Antun_portfolio
I am building my first portfolio with intention to use it in my job application.

## About me

My name is Antun Lucijan MandiÄ‡ and I am a junior machine learning engineer.
For last three years, I've been learning as much as I can about this vast and very advanced field of science.
I have builded very strong mathematics foundations with main focus in statistics and linear algebra.
Then I learned Python.
I also used C/C++ and learned the basics, while for object oriented programming I used Java.
But Python is my main languange, the one I want to grow in and master as much as I can. 
For DBMS I use MySql.

I am very motivated to start working full time, and work for 60+ hours a week, because I know that is the best way to boost up my learning curve.
Solving everyday problems and struggles, in a enviroment with skilled professionals who can help me up and teach me from their own experience, is the way I want to grow and learn. 
Even though I am a last year undergraduate student of computer science in University of Mostar, college is not in my focus right now, because I think that I will learn in a good company at least 10 times as much, as I would listening at those horrible online classes on my uni that are far away from machine learning field.
I have no working experience, this will be my first job in the field, and I am looking for long term commitment.

## About this repository

In this repository, I tried to present some basic notebooks that are necessary for every junior machine learning engineer.
I showed some basic matplotlib plots, introduction to numeric python with numpy, some basic machine learning algorithms wih scikit-learn, and introductionary level of high performance computing with numba.
Pytorch is a framework that I liked very much, and I would like to spend my next few years mastering it.
In the pytroch file I presented introduction to deep learning, CNN-s, RNN-s, then worked with various architectures, like ResNet, VGG, InceptionNet, LeNet, GRU, LSTM and so on...
I know that my protfolio is very far from good, but as I said earlier, I seek true knowledge by looking for a job in the field, and waiting for a senior developer who will teach me, lead me, and I hope have a little bit patience with me.

## Ten-year perspective

I know I am a junior developer, and I know you're well aware that for the first cca six months, I will not benefit your company in any way or make any added value.
But I can assure you that after first few months you will get a very motivated, gratefull and conscientious employee. Then, next four and a half year will be needed so I can become a senior machine learning engineer. I know that because approximately 10.000 working hours are needed to master any skill a become a world class master.
If you want give me opportunity to become a senior developer, I am willing to promise you five more years as a senior in your company so I can repay all you invested in my career.
So, we are talking about 10 year perspective here.
If this proposal sounds interesting to you, please contact me so we can arange a meeting.

### I am so very excited to be a part of the upcoming 4th industrial revolution.
