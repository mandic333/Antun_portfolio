# Antun_portfolio
I am building my first portfolio with intention to use it in my job application.

## About me

My name is Antun Lucijan MandiÄ‡ and I am medior machine learning engineer and full stack developer. 
For the last three years, I've been learning as much as I can about this vast and very advanced field of science. 
I have built very strong mathematics foundations with main focus in statistics and linear algebra. 
I fell in love with Python on the very beginning of my university education, and the love is here to stay for a long time.
Even though I am a 3rd year student at Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Computing and Electrical Engineering, I am looking for a job in the field because I think that is the best way to boost up my learning curve.

I also used C/C++ in my classes and learned the basics, while for object oriented programming I used Java.
Currently, I'm working on C# and .NET project for my Programming Engineering class, and I am writing my bachelor thesis on Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) 
But Python is my main language, the one I want to grow in and master as much as I can. 
For backend development, I use Django, and Django Rest Framework for API development. 
Frontend design is not in my main focus, but I am familiar with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5 and basics of JavaScript. 
For DBMS I use MySQL.

## About this repository

Here, I showed some basic matplotlib plots, introduction to numeric python with numpy, some basic machine learning algorithms with scikit-learn, and introductionary level of high performance computing with numba. 
Pytorch is a framework that I liked very much, and I would like to spend my next few years mastering it. 
In the pytroch file I presented an introduction to deep learning, CNN-s, RNN-s, then worked with various architectures, like ResNet, VGG, InceptionNet, LeNet, GRU, LSTM and so on...
I seek true knowledge by looking for a job in the field, and waiting for a senior developer who will teach me, lead me, and I hope have a little bit patience with me.
I didn't commit any of my Django projects here, but if you call me for an interview, we can speak about them in detail.


### I am so very excited to be a part of the upcoming 4th industrial revolution.
