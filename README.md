# Antun_portfolio
I am building my first portfolio with intention to use it in my job application.

## About me

My name is Antun Lucijan MandiÄ‡ and I am a junior machine learning engineer.
For last three years, I've been learning as much as I can about this vast and very advanced field of science.
I have builded very strong mathematics foundations with main focus in statistics and linear algebra.
Then I learned Python.
I also used C/C++ and learned the basics, while for object oriented programming I used Java.
But Python is my main languange, the one I wanna grow in and master completely. 
For DBMS I use MySql.

I am very motivated to start working full time, and work for 60+ hours a week, because I know that is the best way to boost up my learning curve.
Solving everyday problems and struggles, in a enviroment with skilled professionals who can help me up and teach me from their own experiance, is the way I wanna grow and learn as much as I can. 
Even tho I am a last year undergraduate student of computer science in University of Mostar, collage is not in my focus right now, because I think that I will learn in a good company at least 10 times as much, as I would listening at those horrible online classes on my uni that are far away from machine learning field.

I am so very excited to be a part of the upcoming 4th industrial revolution.
