# Antun_portfolio
I am building my first portfolio with intention to use it in my job application.

## About me

My name is Antun Lucijan MandiÄ‡ and I am a junior machine learning engineer.
For last three years, I've been learning as much as I can about this vast and very advanced field of science.
I have builded very strong mathematics foundations with main focus in statistics and linear algebra.
Then I learned Python.
I also used C/C++ and learned the basics, while for object oriented programming I used Java.
